# story 
In the past few weeks I have been working on my first game ever for my portfolio project in ALX software engineering program. 
In addition to working as a physician in fulltime job as a medical doctor,  I have been using my spare time for learning software engineering in Alx for past 8 month and for my portfolio porject I have shosen to do maze project which is a 3D interactive maze game created using SdL2 and raycasting.
I have been learning basics of coding with different projects before but this is my first project I have to do from scratch. I started with learning SDL functions, rendering, raycasting and adding texture. 
It was very challenging for me because I am already busy with my day job and the time was short to learn new technologies and complete the project at the same timeğŸ˜´ ğŸ¥±   ğŸ¥± ğŸ¥±  ğŸ˜´. To make matters worse my Ubuntu won't let me run the SDL programs I createdğŸ˜ªğŸ˜ªğŸ˜¥ğŸ˜¥ğŸ˜¥ğŸ˜¥. I tried searching for solution , look in to different websites for answers but even after multiple try the best I could do was avoid error messages but still my program won't run properly. Which makes it difficult to see how my codes work and adjust accordinglyğŸ™„ğŸ™„ğŸ™„ğŸ˜¶. So I started setting up SDL, C compiler etc for window and start doing my project again, Which was successful and started to make a progressğŸ˜€ğŸ˜ƒğŸ˜ƒğŸ˜ƒ.
Now I have been able to create an interactive maze where u can move around and see in the map I created ğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘Œ. It's really interesting to see the final out come and considering it's my first game I ever developed I'm really proud of my work. This project teaches me a lot and gives me insight about what I need to know more.
